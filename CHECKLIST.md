## Organization

[C-REEXPORT]: #c-reexport
<a id="c-reexport"></a>
### Crate root re-exports common functionality (C-REEXPORT)

Crates `pub use` the most common types for convenience, so that clients do not
have to remember or write the crate's module hierarchy to use these types.

Re-exporting is covered in more detail in the *The Rust Programming Language*
under [Crates and Modules][reexport].

[reexport]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/crates-and-modules.html#re-exporting-with-pub-use

##### Examples from `serde_json`

The [`serde_json::Value`] type is the most commonly used type from `serde_json`.
It is a re-export of a type that lives elsewhere in the module hierarchy, at
`serde_json::value::Value`. The [`serde_json::value`][value-mod] module defines
other JSON-value-related things that are not re-exported. For example
[`serde_json::value::Index`] is the trait that defines types that can be used to
index into a `Value` using square bracket indexing notation. The `Index` trait
is not re-exported at the crate root because it would be comparatively rare for
a client crate to need to refer to it.

[`serde_json::Value`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/enum.Value.html
[value-mod]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/value/index.html
[`serde_json::value::Index`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/value/trait.Index.html

In addition to types, functions can be re-exported as well. In `serde_json` the
[`serde_json::from_str`] function is a re-export of a function from the
[`serde_json::de`] deserialization module, which contains other less common
deserialization-related functionality that is not re-exported.

[`serde_json::from_str`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/fn.from_str.html
[`serde_json::de`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/de/index.html

[C-HIERARCHY]: #c-hierarchy
<a id="c-hierarchy"></a>
### Modules provide a sensible API hierarchy (C-HIERARCHY)

##### Examples from Serde

The `serde` crate is two independent frameworks in one crate - a serialization
half and a deserialization half. The crate is divided accordingly into
[`serde::ser`] and [`serde::de`]. Part of the deserialization framework is
isolated under [`serde::de::value`] because it is a relatively large API surface
that is relatively unimportant, and it would crowd the more common, more
important functionality located in `serde::de` if it were to share the same
namespace.

[`serde::ser`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde/ser/index.html
[`serde::de`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde/de/index.html
[`serde::de::value`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde/de/value/index.html


<a id="naming"></a>
## Naming

[C-CASE]: #c-case
<a id="c-case"></a>
### Casing conforms to RFC 430 (C-CASE)

Basic Rust naming conventions are described in [RFC 430].

In general, Rust tends to use `CamelCase` for "type-level" constructs (types and
traits) and `snake_case` for "value-level" constructs. More precisely:

| Item | Convention |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Crates | [unclear](https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines/issues/29) |
| Modules | `snake_case` |
| Types | `CamelCase` |
| Traits | `CamelCase` |
| Enum variants | `CamelCase` |
| Functions | `snake_case` |
| Methods | `snake_case` |
| General constructors | `new` or `with_more_details` |
| Conversion constructors | `from_some_other_type` |
| Local variables | `snake_case` |
| Static variables | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |
| Constant variables | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |
| Type parameters | concise `CamelCase`, usually single uppercase letter: `T` |
| Lifetimes | short `lowercase`, usually a single letter: `'a`, `'de`, `'src` |

In `CamelCase`, acronyms count as one word: use `Uuid` rather than `UUID`. In
`snake_case`, acronyms are lower-cased: `is_xid_start`.

In `snake_case` or `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, a "word" should never consist of a
single letter unless it is the last "word". So, we have `btree_map` rather than
`b_tree_map`, but `PI_2` rather than `PI2`.

##### Examples from the standard library

The whole standard library. This guideline should be easy!

[C-CONV]: #c-conv
<a id="c-conv"></a>
### Ad-hoc conversions follow `as_`, `to_`, `into_` conventions (C-CONV)

Conversions should be provided as methods, with names prefixed as follows:

| Prefix | Cost | Ownership |
| ------ | ---- | --------- |
| `as_` | Free | borrowed -\> borrowed |
| `to_` | Expensive | borrowed -\> owned |
| `into_` | Variable | owned -\> owned |

For example:

- [`str::as_bytes()`] gives a `&[u8]` view into a `&str`, which is free.
- [`str::to_owned()`] copies a `&str` to a new `String`, which may require memory
  allocation.
- [`String::into_bytes()`] takes ownership a `String` and yields the underlying
  `Vec<u8>`, which is free.
- [`BufReader::into_inner()`] takes ownership of a buffered reader and extracts
  out the underlying reader, which is free. Data in the buffer is
  discarded.
- [`BufWriter::into_inner()`] takes ownership of a buffered writer and extracts
  out the underlying writer, which requires a potentially expensive flush of any
  buffered data.

[`str::as_bytes()`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.as_bytes
[`str::to_owned()`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.to_owned
[`String::into_bytes()`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.into_bytes
[`BufReader::into_inner()`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html#method.into_inner
[`BufWriter::into_inner()`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufWriter.html#method.into_inner

Conversions prefixed `as_` and `into_` typically _decrease abstraction_, either
exposing a view into the underlying representation (`as`) or deconstructing data
into its underlying representation (`into`). Conversions prefixed `to_`, on the
other hand, typically stay at the same level of abstraction but do some work to
change one representation into another.

##### More examples from the standard library

- [`Result::as_ref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.as_ref)
- [`RefCell::as_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.as_ptr)
- [`Path::to_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html#method.to_str)
- [`slice::to_vec`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.to_vec)
- [`Option::into_iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.into_iter)
- [`AtomicBool::into_inner`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html#method.into_inner)

[C-ITER]: #c-iter
<a id="c-iter"></a>
### Methods on collections that produce iterators follow `iter`, `iter_mut`, `into_iter` (C-ITER)

Per [RFC 199].

For a container with elements of type `U`, iterator methods should be named:

```rust
fn iter(&self) -> Iter             // Iter implements Iterator<Item = &U>
fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut  // IterMut implements Iterator<Item = &mut U>
fn into_iter(self) -> IntoIter     // IntoIter implements Iterator<Item = U>
```

This guideline applies to data structures that are conceptually homogeneous
collections. As a counterexample, the `str` type is slice of bytes that are
guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. This is conceptually more nuanced than a
homogeneous collection so rather than providing the
`iter`/`iter_mut`/`into_iter` group of iterator methods, it provides
[`str::bytes`] to iterate as bytes and [`str::chars`] to iterate as chars.

[`str::bytes`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.bytes
[`str::chars`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.chars

This guideline applies to methods only, not functions. For example
[`percent_encode`] from the `url` crate returns an iterator over percent-encoded
string fragments. There would be no clarity to be had by using an
`iter`/`iter_mut`/`into_iter` convention.

[`percent_encode`]: https://docs.rs/url/1.4.0/url/percent_encoding/fn.percent_encode.html

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`Vec::iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.iter)
- [`Vec::iter_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.iter_mut)
- [`Vec::into_iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.into_iter)
- [`BTreeMap::iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.iter)
- [`BTreeMap::iter_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.iter_mut)

[C-ITER-TY]: #c-iter-ty
<a id="c-iter-ty"></a>
### Iterator type names match the methods that produce them (C-ITER-TY)

A method called `into_iter()` should return a type called `IntoIter` and
similarly for all other methods that return iterators.

This guideline applies chiefly to methods, but often makes sense for functions
as well. For example the [`percent_encode`] function from the `url` crate
returns an iterator type called [`PercentEncode`][PercentEncode-type].

[PercentEncode-type]: https://docs.rs/url/1.4.0/url/percent_encoding/struct.PercentEncode.html

These type names make the most sense when prefixed with their owning module, for
example [`vec::IntoIter`].

[`vec::IntoIter`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.IntoIter.html

##### Examples from the standard library

* [`Vec::iter`] returns [`Iter`][slice::Iter]
* [`Vec::iter_mut`] returns [`IterMut`][slice::IterMut]
* [`Vec::into_iter`] returns [`IntoIter`][vec::IntoIter]
* [`BTreeMap::keys`] returns [`Keys`][btree_map::Keys]
* [`BTreeMap::values`] returns [`Values`][btree_map::Values]

[`Vec::iter`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.iter
[slice::Iter]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/struct.Iter.html
[`Vec::iter_mut`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.iter_mut
[slice::IterMut]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/struct.IterMut.html
[`Vec::into_iter`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.into_iter
[vec::IntoIter]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.IntoIter.html
[`BTreeMap::keys`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.keys
[btree_map::Keys]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/btree_map/struct.Keys.html
[`BTreeMap::values`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.values
[btree_map::Values]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/btree_map/struct.Values.html

[C-OWN-SUFFIX]: #c-own-suffix
<a id="c-own-suffix"></a>
### Ownership suffixes use `_mut`, `_ref` (C-OWN-SUFFIX)

Functions often come in multiple variants: immutably borrowed, mutably borrowed,
and owned.

The right default depends on the function in question. Variants should be marked
through suffixes.

#### Exceptions

In the case of iterators, the moving variant can also be understood as an `into`
conversion, `into_iter`, and `for x in v.into_iter()` reads arguably better than
`for x in v.iter_move()`, so the convention is `into_iter`.

For mutably borrowed variants, if the `mut` qualifier is part of a type name,
it should appear as it would appear in the type. For example
[`Vec::as_mut_slice`] returns a mut slice; it does what it says.

[`Vec::as_mut_slice`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_mut_slice

#### Immutably borrowed by default

If `foo` uses/produces an immutable borrow by default, use:

* The `_mut` suffix (e.g. `foo_mut`) for the mutably borrowed variant.
* The `_move` suffix (e.g. `foo_move`) for the owned variant.

##### Examples from the standard library

TODO [rust-api-guidelines#37](https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines/issues/37)

#### Owned by default

If `foo` uses/produces owned data by default, use:

* The `_ref` suffix (e.g. `foo_ref`) for the immutably borrowed variant.
* The `_mut` suffix (e.g. `foo_mut`) for the mutably borrowed variant.

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`std::io::BufReader::get_ref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html#method.get_ref)
- [`std::io::BufReader::get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html#method.get_mut)

[C-GETTERS]: #c-getters
<a id="c-getters"></a>
### Single-element containers implement appropriate getters (C-GETTERS)

Single-element containers where accessing the element cannot fail should
implement `get` and `get_mut`, with the following signatures.

```rust
fn get(&self) -> &V;
fn get_mut(&mut self) -> &mut V;
```

Single-element containers where the element is [`Copy`] (e.g. [`Cell`]-like
containers) should instead return the value directly, and not implement a
mutable accessor. TODO [rust-api-guidelines#44]

[rust-api-guidelines#44]: https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines/issues/44

[`Copy`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html
[`Cell`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html

```rust
fn get(&self) -> V;
```

For getters that do runtime validation, consider adding unsafe `_unchecked`
variants.

```rust
unsafe fn get_unchecked(&self, index) -> &V;
```

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`std::io::Cursor::get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Cursor.html#method.get_mut)
- [`std::ptr::Unique::get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/struct.Unique.html#method.get_mut)
- [`std::sync::PoisonError::get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.PoisonError.html#method.get_mut)
- [`std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool::get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html#method.get_mut)
- [`std::collections::hash_map::OccupiedEntry::get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/struct.OccupiedEntry.html#method.get_mut)
- [`<[_]>::get_unchecked`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_unchecked)


<a id="interoperability"></a>
## Interoperability

[C-COMMON-TRAITS]: #c-common-traits
<a id="c-common-traits"></a>
### Types eagerly implement common traits (C-COMMON-TRAITS)

Rust's trait system does not allow _orphans_: roughly, every `impl` must live
either in the crate that defines the trait or the implementing type.
Consequently, crates that define new types should eagerly implement all
applicable, common traits.

To see why, consider the following situation:

* Crate `std` defines trait `Display`.
* Crate `url` defines type `Url`, without implementing `Display`.
* Crate `webapp` imports from both `std` and `url`,

There is no way for `webapp` to add `Display` to `url`, since it defines
neither. (Note: the newtype pattern can provide an efficient, but inconvenient
workaround.

The most important common traits to implement from `std` are:

- [`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html)
- [`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html)
- [`Eq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html)
- [`PartialEq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html)
- [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html)
- [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html)
- [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html)
- [`Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html)
- [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html)
- [`Default`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html)

[C-CONV-TRAITS]: #c-conv-traits
<a id="c-conv-traits"></a>
### Conversions use the standard traits `From`, `AsRef`, `AsMut` (C-CONV-TRAITS)

The following conversion traits should be implemented where it makes sense:

- [`From`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html)
- [`TryFrom`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.TryFrom.html)
- [`AsRef`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html)
- [`AsMut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsMut.html)

The following conversion traits should never be implemented:

- [`Into`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html)
- [`TryInto`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.TryInto.html)

These traits have a blanket impl based on `From` and `TryFrom`. Implement those
instead.

##### Examples from the standard library

- `From<u16>` is implemented for `u32` because a smaller integer can always be
  converted to a bigger integer.
- `From<u32>` is *not* implemented for `u16` because the conversion may not be
  possible if the integer is too big.
- `TryFrom<u32>` is implemented for `u16` and returns an error if the integer is
  too big to fit in `u16`.
- [`From<Ipv6Addr>`] is implemented for [`IpAddr`], which is a type that can
  represent both v4 and v6 IP addresses.

[`From<Ipv6Addr>`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.Ipv6Addr.html
[`IpAddr`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.IpAddr.html

[C-COLLECT]: #c-collect
<a id="c-collect"></a>
### Collections implement `FromIterator` and `Extend` (C-COLLECT)

[`FromIterator`] and [`Extend`] enable collections to be used conveniently with
the following iterator methods:

[`FromIterator`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.FromIterator.html
[`Extend`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Extend.html

- [`Iterator::collect`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.collect)
- [`Iterator::partition`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.partition)
- [`Iterator::unzip`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.unzip)

`FromIterator` is for creating a new collection containing items from an
iterator, and `Extend` is for adding items from an iterator onto an existing
collection.

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`Vec<T>`] implements both `FromIterator<T>` and `Extend<T>`.

[`Vec<T>`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html

[C-SERDE]: #c-serde
<a id="c-serde"></a>
### Data structures implement Serde's `Serialize`, `Deserialize` (C-SERDE)

Types that play the role of a data structure should implement [`Serialize`] and
[`Deserialize`].

An example of a type that plays the role of a data structure is
[`linked_hash_map::LinkedHashMap`].

An example of a type that does not play the role of a data structure is
[`byteorder::LittleEndian`].

[`Serialize`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde/trait.Serialize.html
[`Deserialize`]: https://docs.serde.rs/serde/trait.Deserialize.html
[`byteorder::LittleEndian`]: https://docs.rs/byteorder/1.0.0/byteorder/enum.LittleEndian.html
[`linked_hash_map::LinkedHashMap`]: https://docs.rs/linked-hash-map/0.4.2/linked_hash_map/struct.LinkedHashMap.html

[C-SERDE-CFG]: #c-serde-cfg
<a id="c-serde-cfg"></a>
### Crate has a `"serde"` cfg option that enables Serde (C-SERDE-CFG)

If the crate relies on `serde_derive` to provide Serde impls, the name of the
cfg can still be simply `"serde"` by using [this workaround]. Do not use a
different name for the cfg like `"serde_impls"` or `"serde_serialization"`.

[this workaround]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/v1.0.0/serde/src/lib.rs#L222-L260

[C-SEND-SYNC]: #c-send-sync
<a id="c-send-sync"></a>
### Types are `Send` and `Sync` where possible (C-SEND-SYNC)

[`Send`] and [`Sync`] are automatically implemented when the compiler determines
it is appropriate.

[`Send`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html
[`Sync`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html

In types that manipulate raw pointers, be vigilant that the `Send` and `Sync`
status of your type accurately reflects its thread safety characteristics. Tests
like the following can help catch unintentional regressions in whether the type
implements `Send` or `Sync`.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_send() {
    fn assert_send<T: Send>() {}
    assert_send::<MyStrangeType>();
}

#[test]
fn test_sync() {
    fn assert_sync<T: Sync>() {}
    assert_sync::<MyStrangeType>();
}
```

[C-SEND-SYNC-ERR]: #c-send-sync-err
<a id="c-send-sync-err"></a>
### Error types are `Send` and `Sync` (C-SEND-SYNC-ERR)

An error that is not `Send` cannot be returned by a thread run with
[`thread::spawn`]. An error that is not `Sync` cannot be passed across threads
using an [`Arc`]. These are common requirements for basic error handling in a
multithreaded application.

[`thread::spawn`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html
[`Arc`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html

[C-MEANINGFUL-ERR]: #c-meaningful-err
<a id="c-meaningful-err"></a>
### Error types are meaningful, not `()` (C-MEANINGFUL-ERR)

When defining functions that return `Result`, and the error carries no
useful additional information, do not use `()` as the error type. `()`
does not implement `std::error::Error`, and this causes problems for
callers that expect to be able to convert errors to `Error`. Common
error handling libraries like [error-chain] expect errors to implement
`Error`.

[error-chain]: https://docs.rs/error-chain

Instead, define a meaningful error type specific to your crate.

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`ParseBoolError`] is returned when failing to parse a bool from a string.

[`ParseBoolError`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/struct.ParseBoolError.html

[C-NUM-FMT]: #c-num-fmt
<a id="c-num-fmt"></a>
### Binary number types provide `Hex`, `Octal`, `Binary` formatting (C-NUM-FMT)

- [`std::fmt::UpperHex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.UpperHex.html)
- [`std::fmt::LowerHex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.LowerHex.html)
- [`std::fmt::Octal`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Octal.html)
- [`std::fmt::Binary`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Binary.html)

These traits control the representation of a type under the `{:X}`, `{:x}`,
`{:o}`, and `{:b}` format specifiers.

Implement these traits for any number type on which you would consider doing
bitwise manipulations like `|` or `&`. This is especially appropriate for
bitflag types. Numeric quantity types like `struct Nanoseconds(u64)` probably do
not need these.


<a id="macros"></a>
## Macros

[C-EVOCATIVE]: #c-evocative
<a id="c-evocative"></a>
### Input syntax is evocative of the output (C-EVOCATIVE)

Rust macros let you dream up practically whatever input syntax you want. Aim to
keep input syntax familiar and cohesive with the rest of your users' code by
mirroring existing Rust syntax where possible. Pay attention to the choice and
placement of keywords and punctuation.

A good guide is to use syntax, especially keywords and punctuation, that is
similar to what will be produced in the output of the macro.

For example if your macro declares a struct with a particular name given in the
input, preface the name with the keyword `struct` to signal to readers that a
struct is being declared with the given name.

```rust
// Prefer this...
bitflags! {
    struct S: u32 { /* ... */ }
}

// ...over no keyword...
bitflags! {
    S: u32 { /* ... */ }
}

// ...or some ad-hoc word.
bitflags! {
    flags S: u32 { /* ... */ }
}
```

Another example is semicolons vs commas. Constants in Rust are followed by
semicolons so if your macro declares a chain of constants, they should likely be
followed by semicolons even if the syntax is otherwise slightly different from
Rust's.

```rust
// Ordinary constants use semicolons.
const A: u32 = 0b000001;
const B: u32 = 0b000010;

// So prefer this...
bitflags! {
    struct S: u32 {
        const C = 0b000100;
        const D = 0b001000;
    }
}

// ...over this.
bitflags! {
    struct S: u32 {
        const E = 0b010000,
        const F = 0b100000,
    }
}
```

Macros are so diverse that these specific examples won't be relevant, but think
about how to apply the same principles to your situation.

[C-MACRO-ATTR]: #c-macro-attr
<a id="c-macro-attr"></a>
### Item macros compose well with attributes (C-MACRO-ATTR)

Macros that produce more than one output item should support adding attributes
to any one of those items. One common use case would be putting individual items
behind a cfg.

```rust
bitflags! {
    struct Flags: u8 {
        #[cfg(windows)]
        const ControlCenter = 0b001;
        #[cfg(unix)]
        const Terminal = 0b010;
    }
}
```

Macros that produce a struct or enum as output should support attributes so that
the output can be used with derive.

```rust
bitflags! {
    #[derive(Default, Serialize)]
    struct Flags: u8 {
        const ControlCenter = 0b001;
        const Terminal = 0b010;
    }
}
```

[C-ANYWHERE]: #c-anywhere
<a id="c-anywhere"></a>
### Item macros work anywhere that items are allowed (C-ANYWHERE)

Rust allows items to be placed at the module level or within a tighter scope
like a function. Item macros should work equally well as ordinary items in all
of these places. The test suite should include invocations of the macro in at
least the module scope and function scope.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    test_your_macro_in_a!(module);

    #[test]
    fn anywhere() {
        test_your_macro_in_a!(function);
    }
}
```

As a simple example of how things can go wrong, this macro works great in a
module scope but fails in a function scope.

```rust
macro_rules! broken {
    ($m:ident :: $t:ident) => {
        pub struct $t;
        pub mod $m {
            pub use super::$t;
        }
    }
}

broken!(m::T); // okay, expands to T and m::T

fn g() {
    broken!(m::U); // fails to compile, super::U refers to the containing module not g
}
```

[C-MACRO-VIS]: #c-macro-vis
<a id="c-macro-vis"></a>
### Item macros support visibility specifiers (C-MACRO-VIS)

Follow Rust syntax for visibility of items produced by a macro. Private by
default, public if `pub` is specified.

```rust
bitflags! {
    struct PrivateFlags: u8 {
        const A = 0b0001;
        const B = 0b0010;
    }
}

bitflags! {
    pub struct PublicFlags: u8 {
        const C = 0b0100;
        const D = 0b1000;
    }
}
```

[C-MACRO-TY]: #c-macro-ty
<a id="c-macro-ty"></a>
### Type fragments are flexible (C-MACRO-TY)

If your macro accepts a type fragment like `$t:ty` in the input, it should be
usable with all of the following:

- Primitives: `u8`, `&str`
- Relative paths: `m::Data`
- Absolute paths: `::base::Data`
- Upward relative paths: `super::Data`
- Generics: `Vec<String>`

As a simple example of how things can go wrong, this macro works great with
primitives and absolute paths but fails with relative paths.

```rust
macro_rules! broken {
    ($m:ident => $t:ty) => {
        pub mod $m {
            pub struct Wrapper($t);
        }
    }
}

broken!(a => u8); // okay

broken!(b => ::std::marker::PhantomData<()>); // okay

struct S;
broken!(c => S); // fails to compile
```


<a id="documentation"></a>
## Documentation

[C-CRATE-DOC]: #c-crate-doc
<a id="c-crate-doc"></a>
### Crate level docs are thorough and include examples (C-CRATE-DOC)

See [RFC 1687].

[C-EXAMPLE]: #c-example
<a id="c-example"></a>
### All items have a rustdoc example (C-EXAMPLE)

Every public module, trait, struct, enum, function, method, macro, and type
definition should have an example that exercises the functionality.

The purpose of an example is not always to show *how to use* the item. For
example users can be expected to know how to instantiate and match on an enum
like `enum E { A, B }`. Rather, an example is often intended to show *why
someone would want to use* the item.

This guideline should be applied within reason.

A link to an applicable example on another item may be sufficient. For example
if exactly one function uses a particular type, it may be appropriate to write a
single example on either the function or the type and link to it from the other.

[C-QUESTION-MARK]: #c-question-mark
<a id="c-question-mark"></a>
### Examples use `?`, not `try!`, not `unwrap` (C-QUESTION-MARK)

Like it or not, example code is often copied verbatim by users. Unwrapping an
error should be a conscious decision that the user needs to make.

A common way of structuring fallible example code is the following. The lines
beginning with `#` are compiled by `cargo test` when building the example but
will not appear in user-visible rustdoc.

```
/// ```rust
/// # use std::error::Error;
/// #
/// # fn try_main() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
/// your;
/// example?;
/// code;
/// #
/// #     Ok(())
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// #     try_main().unwrap();
/// # }
/// ```
```

[C-ERROR-DOC]: #c-error-doc
<a id="c-error-doc"></a>
### Function docs include error conditions in "Errors" section (C-ERROR-DOC)

Per [RFC 1574].

This applies to trait methods as well. Trait methods for which the
implementation is allowed or expected to return an error should be documented
with an "Errors" section.

##### Examples from the standard library

Some implementations of the [`std::io::Read::read`] trait method may return an
error.

[`std::io::Read::read`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#tymethod.read

```
/// Pull some bytes from this source into the specified buffer, returning
/// how many bytes were read.
///
/// ... lots more info ...
///
/// # Errors
///
/// If this function encounters any form of I/O or other error, an error
/// variant will be returned. If an error is returned then it must be
/// guaranteed that no bytes were read.
```

[C-PANIC-DOC]: #c-panic-doc
<a id="c-panic-doc"></a>
### Function docs include panic conditions in "Panics" section (C-PANIC-DOC)

Per [RFC 1574].

This applies to trait methods as well. Traits methods for which the
implementation is allowed or expected to panic should be documented with a
"Panics" section.

##### Examples from the standard library

The [`Vec::insert`] method may panic.

[`Vec::insert`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.insert

```
/// Inserts an element at position `index` within the vector, shifting all
/// elements after it to the right.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if `index` is out of bounds.
```

[C-LINK]: #c-link
<a id="c-link"></a>
### Prose contains hyperlinks to relevant things (C-LINK)

Links to methods within the same type usually look like this:

```md
[`serialize_struct`]: #method.serialize_struct
```

Links to other types usually look like this:

[`Deserialize`]: trait.Deserialize.html
```

Links may also point to a parent or child module:

[C-CI]: #c-ci
<a id="c-ci"></a>
### Cargo.toml publishes CI badges for tier 1 platforms (C-CI)

The Rust compiler regards [tier 1 platforms] as "guaranteed to work."
Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:

[tier 1 platforms]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html#tier-1

- Official binary releases are provided for the platform.
- Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.
- Landing changes to the rust-lang/rust repository's master branch is gated on
  tests passing.
- Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.

Stable, high-profile crates should meet the same level of rigor when it comes to
tier 1. To prove it, Cargo.toml should publish [CI badges].

[CI badges]: http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#package-metadata

```toml
[badges]
travis-ci = { repository = "..." }
appveyor = { repository = "..." }
```

[C-METADATA]: #c-metadata
<a id="c-metadata"></a>
### Cargo.toml includes all common metadata (C-METADATA)

- `authors`
- `description`
- `license`
- `homepage` (though see [rust-api-guidelines#26](https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines/issues/26))
- `documentation`
- `repository`

- `keywords`
- `categories`

[C-HTML-ROOT]: #c-html-root
<a id="c-html-root"></a>
### Crate sets html_root_url attribute (C-HTML-ROOT)

It should point to `"https://docs.rs/$crate/$version"`.

Cargo.toml should contain a note next to the version to remember to bump the
`html_root_url` when bumping the crate version.

[C-DOCS-RS]: #c-docs-rs
<a id="c-docs-rs"></a>
### Cargo.toml documentation key points to docs.rs (C-DOCS-RS)

It should point to `"https://docs.rs/$crate"`.

[C-RELNOTES]: #c-relnotes
<a id="c-relnotes"></a>
### Release notes document all significant changes (C-RELNOTES)

Users of the crate can read the release notes to find a summary of what
changed in each published release of the crate.  A link to the release notes,
or the notes themselves, should be included in the crate-level documentation
and/or the repository linked in Cargo.toml.

Breaking changes (as defined in [RFC 1105]) should be clearly identified in the
release notes.

<a id="predictability"></a>
## Predictability

[C-SMART-PTR]: #c-smart-ptr
<a id="c-smart-ptr"></a>
### Smart pointers do not add inherent methods (C-SMART-PTR)

For example, this is why the [`Box::into_raw`] function is defined the way it
is.

[`Box::into_raw`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.into_raw

```rust
impl<T> Box<T> where T: ?Sized {
    fn into_raw(b: Box<T>) -> *mut T { /* ... */ }
}

let boxed_str: Box<str> = /* ... */;
let ptr = Box::into_raw(boxed_str);
```

If this were defined as an inherent method instead, it would be confusing at the
call site whether the method being called is a method on `Box<T>` or a method on
`T`.

```rust
impl<T> Box<T> where T: ?Sized {
    // Do not do this.
    fn into_raw(self) -> *mut T { /* ... */ }
}

let boxed_str: Box<str> = /* ... */;

// This is a method on str accessed through the smart pointer Deref impl.
boxed_str.chars()

// This is a method on Box<str>...?
boxed_str.into_raw()
```

[C-CONV-SPECIFIC]: #c-conv-specific
<a id="c-conv-specific"></a>
### Conversions live on the most specific type involved (C-CONV-SPECIFIC)

When in doubt, prefer `to_`/`as_`/`into_` to `from_`, because they are more
ergonomic to use (and can be chained with other methods).

For many conversions between two types, one of the types is clearly more
"specific": it provides some additional invariant or interpretation that is not
present in the other type. For example, [`str`] is more specific than `&[u8]`,
since it is a UTF-8 encoded sequence of bytes.

[`str`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html

Conversions should live with the more specific of the involved types. Thus,
`str` provides both the [`as_bytes`] method and the [`from_utf8`] constructor
for converting to and from `&[u8]` values. Besides being intuitive, this
convention avoids polluting concrete types like `&[u8]` with endless conversion
methods.

[`as_bytes`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.as_bytes
[`from_utf8`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/fn.from_utf8.html

[C-METHOD]: #c-method
<a id="c-method"></a>
### Functions with a clear receiver are methods (C-METHOD)

Prefer

```rust
impl Foo {
    pub fn frob(&self, w: widget) { /* ... */ }
}
```

over

```rust
pub fn frob(foo: &Foo, w: widget) { /* ... */ }
```

for any operation that is clearly associated with a particular type.

Methods have numerous advantages over functions:

* They do not need to be imported or qualified to be used: all you need is a
  value of the appropriate type.
* Their invocation performs autoborrowing (including mutable borrows).
* They make it easy to answer the question "what can I do with a value of type
  `T`" (especially when using rustdoc).
* They provide `self` notation, which is more concise and often more clearly
  conveys ownership distinctions.

[C-NO-OUT]: #c-no-out
<a id="c-no-out"></a>
### Functions do not take out-parameters (C-NO-OUT)

Prefer

```rust
fn foo() -> (Bar, Bar)
```

over

```rust
fn foo(output: &mut Bar) -> Bar
```

for returning multiple `Bar` values.

Compound return types like tuples and structs are efficiently compiled and do
not require heap allocation. If a function needs to return multiple values, it
should do so via one of these types.

The primary exception: sometimes a function is meant to modify data that the
caller already owns, for example to re-use a buffer:

```rust
fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<usize>
```

[C-OVERLOAD]: #c-overload
<a id="c-overload"></a>
### Operator overloads are unsurprising (C-OVERLOAD)

Operators with built in syntax (`*`, `|`, and so on) can be provided for a type
by implementing the traits in [`std::ops`]. These operators come with strong
expectations: implement `Mul` only for an operation that bears some resemblance
to multiplication (and shares the expected properties, e.g. associativity), and
so on for the other traits.

[`std::ops`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/index.html#traits

[C-DEREF]: #c-deref
<a id="c-deref"></a>
### Only smart pointers implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` (C-DEREF)

The `Deref` traits are used implicitly by the compiler in many circumstances,
and interact with method resolution. The relevant rules are designed
specifically to accommodate smart pointers, and so the traits should be used
only for that purpose.

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html)
- [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a smart
  pointer to [`str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html)
- [`Rc<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html)
- [`Arc<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html)
- [`Cow<'a, T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/enum.Cow.html)

[C-DEREF-FAIL]: #c-deref-fail
<a id="c-deref-fail"></a>
### `Deref` and `DerefMut` never fail (C-DEREF-FAIL)

Because the `Deref` traits are invoked implicitly by the compiler in sometimes
subtle ways, failure during dereferencing can be extremely confusing.

[C-CTOR]: #c-ctor
<a id="c-ctor"></a>
### Constructors are static, inherent methods (C-CTOR)

In Rust, "constructors" are just a convention:

```rust
impl<T> Example<T> {
    pub fn new() -> Example<T> { /* ... */ }
}
```

Constructors are static (no `self`) inherent methods for the type that they
construct. Combined with the practice of fully importing type names, this
convention leads to informative but concise construction:

```rust
use example::Example;

// Construct a new Example.
let ex = Example::new();
```

This convention also applied to conversion constructors (prefix `from` rather
than `new`).

Constructors for structs with sensible defaults allow clients to concisely
override using the [struct update syntax].

[struct update syntax]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/structs.html#update-syntax

```rust
pub struct Config {
    pub color: Color,
    pub size: Size,
    pub shape: Shape,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn new() -> Config {
        Config {
            color: Brown,
            size: Medium,
            shape: Square,
        }
    }
}

// In user's code.
let config = Config { color: Red, .. Config::new() };
```

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`std::io::Error::new`] is the commonly used constructor for an IO error.
- [`std::io::Error::from_raw_os_error`] is a constructor based on an error code
  received from the operating system.

[`std::io::Error::new`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Error.html#method.new
[`std::io::Error::from_raw_os_error`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Error.html#method.from_raw_os_error


<a id="flexibility"></a>
## Flexibility

[C-INTERMEDIATE]: #c-intermediate
<a id="c-intermediate"></a>
### Functions expose intermediate results to avoid duplicate work (C-INTERMEDIATE)

Many functions that answer a question also compute interesting related data. If
this data is potentially of interest to the client, consider exposing it in the
API.

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`Vec::binary_search`] does not return a `bool` of whether the value was
  found, nor an `Option<usize>` of the index at which the value was maybe found.
  Instead it returns information about the index if found, and also the index at
  which the value would need to be inserted if not found.

- [`String::from_utf8`] may fail if the input bytes are not UTF-8. In the error
  case it returns an intermediate result that exposes the byte offset up to
  which the input was valid UTF-8, as well as handing back ownership of the
  input bytes.

[`Vec::binary_search`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.binary_search
[`String::from_utf8`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8

[C-CALLER-CONTROL]: #c-caller-control
<a id="c-caller-control"></a>
### Caller decides where to copy and place data (C-CALLER-CONTROL)

If a function requires ownership of an argument, it should take ownership of the
argument rather than borrowing and cloning the argument.

```rust
// Prefer this:
fn foo(b: Bar) {
    /* use b as owned, directly */
}

// Over this:
fn foo(b: &Bar) {
    let b = b.clone();
    /* use b as owned after cloning */
}
```

If a function *does not* require ownership of an argument, it should take a
shared or exclusive borrow of the argument rather than taking ownership and
dropping the argument.

```rust
// Prefer this:
fn foo(b: &Bar) {
    /* use b as borrowed */
}

// Over this:
fn foo(b: Bar) {
    /* use b as borrowed, it is implicitly dropped before function returns */
}
```

The `Copy` trait should only be used as a bound when absolutely needed, not as a
way of signaling that copies should be cheap to make.

[C-GENERIC]: #c-generic
<a id="c-generic"></a>
### Functions minimize assumptions about parameters by using generics (C-GENERIC)

The fewer assumptions a function makes about its inputs, the more widely usable
it becomes.

Prefer

```rust
fn foo<I: Iterator<Item = i64>>(iter: I) { /* ... */ }
```

over any of

```rust
fn foo(c: &[i64]) { /* ... */ }
fn foo(c: &Vec<i64>) { /* ... */ }
fn foo(c: &SomeOtherCollection<i64>) { /* ... */ }
```

if the function only needs to iterate over the data.

More generally, consider using generics to pinpoint the assumptions a function
needs to make about its arguments.

##### Advantages of generics

* _Reusability_. Generic functions can be applied to an open-ended collection of
  types, while giving a clear contract for the functionality those types must
  provide.

* _Static dispatch and optimization_. Each use of a generic function is
  specialized ("monomorphized") to the particular types implementing the trait
  bounds, which means that (1) invocations of trait methods are static, direct
  calls to the implementation and (2) the compiler can inline and otherwise
  optimize these calls.

* _Inline layout_. If a `struct` and `enum` type is generic over some type
  parameter `T`, values of type `T` will be laid out inline in the
  `struct`/`enum`, without any indirection.

* _Inference_. Since the type parameters to generic functions can usually be
  inferred, generic functions can help cut down on verbosity in code where
  explicit conversions or other method calls would usually be necessary.

* _Precise types_. Because generic give a _name_ to the specific type
  implementing a trait, it is possible to be precise about places where that
  exact type is required or produced. For example, a function

  ```rust
  fn binary<T: Trait>(x: T, y: T) -> T
  ```

  is guaranteed to consume and produce elements of exactly the same type `T`; it
  cannot be invoked with parameters of different types that both implement
  `Trait`.

##### Disadvantages of generics

* _Code size_. Specializing generic functions means that the function body is
  duplicated. The increase in code size must be weighed against the performance
  benefits of static dispatch.

* _Homogeneous types_. This is the other side of the "precise types" coin: if
  `T` is a type parameter, it stands for a _single_ actual type. So for example
  a `Vec<T>` contains elements of a single concrete type (and, indeed, the
  vector representation is specialized to lay these out in line). Sometimes
  heterogeneous collections are useful; see [trait objects][C-OBJECT].

* _Signature verbosity_. Heavy use of generics can make it more difficult to
  read and understand a function's signature.

##### Examples from the standard library

- [`std::fs::File::open`] takes an argument of generic type `AsRef<Path>`. This
  allows files to be opened conveniently from a string literal `"f.txt"`, a
  [`Path`], an [`OsString`], and a few other types.

[C-OBJECT]: #c-object
<a id="c-object"></a>
### Traits are object-safe if they may be useful as a trait object (C-OBJECT)

Trait objects have some significant limitations: methods invoked through a trait
object cannot use generics, and cannot use `Self` except in receiver position.

When designing a trait, decide early on whether the trait will be used as an
object or as a bound on generics.

If a trait is meant to be used as an object, its methods should take and return
trait objects rather than use generics.

A `where` clause of `Self: Sized` may be used to exclude specific methods from
the trait's object. The following trait is not object-safe due to the generic
method.

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn object_safe(&self, i: i32);

    fn not_object_safe<T>(&self, t: T);
}
```

Adding a requirement of `Self: Sized` to the generic method excludes it from the
trait object and makes the trait object-safe.

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn object_safe(&self, i: i32);

    fn not_object_safe<T>(&self, t: T) where Self: Sized;
}
```

##### Advantages of trait objects

* _Heterogeneity_. When you need it, you really need it.
* _Code size_. Unlike generics, trait objects do not generate specialized
  (monomorphized) versions of code, which can greatly reduce code size.

##### Disadvantages of trait objects

* _No generic methods_. Trait objects cannot currently provide generic methods.
* _Dynamic dispatch and fat pointers_. Trait objects inherently involve
  indirection and vtable dispatch, which can carry a performance penalty.
* _No Self_. Except for the method receiver argument, methods on trait objects
  cannot use the `Self` type.

##### Examples from the standard library

- The [`io::Read`] and [`io::Write`] traits are often used as objects.
- The [`Iterator`] trait has several generic methods marked with `where Self:
  Sized` to retain the ability to use `Iterator` as an object.

[`io::Read`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html
[`io::Write`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html
[`Iterator`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html

## Type safety

[C-NEWTYPE]: #c-newtype
<a id="c-newtype"></a>
### Newtypes provide static distinctions (C-NEWTYPE)

Newtypes can statically distinguish between different interpretations of an
underlying type.

For example, a `f64` value might be used to represent a quantity in miles or in
kilometers. Using newtypes, we can keep track of the intended interpretation:

```rust
struct Miles(pub f64);
struct Kilometers(pub f64);

impl Miles {
    fn as_kilometers(&self) -> Kilometers { /* ... */ }
}
impl Kilometers {
    fn as_miles(&self) -> Miles { /* ... */ }
}
```

Once we have separated these two types, we can statically ensure that we do not
confuse them. For example, the function

```rust
fn are_we_there_yet(distance_travelled: Miles) -> bool { /* ... */ }
```

cannot accidentally be called with a `Kilometers` value. The compiler will
remind us to perform the conversion, thus averting certain [catastrophic bugs].

[catastrophic bugs]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter

[C-CUSTOM-TYPE]: #c-custom-type
<a id="c-custom-type"></a>
### Arguments convey meaning through types, not `bool` or `Option` (C-CUSTOM-TYPE)

Prefer

```rust
let w = Widget::new(Small, Round)
```

over

```rust
let w = Widget::new(true, false)
```

Core types like `bool`, `u8` and `Option` have many possible interpretations.

Use custom types (whether `enum`s, `struct`, or tuples) to convey interpretation
and invariants. In the above example, it is not immediately clear what `true`
and `false` are conveying without looking up the argument names, but `Small` and
`Round` are more suggestive.

Using custom types makes it easier to expand the options later on, for example
by adding an `ExtraLarge` variant.

See [the newtype pattern][C-NEWTYPE] for a no-cost way to wrap existing types
with a distinguished name.

[C-BITFLAG]: #c-bitflag
<a id="c-bitflag"></a>
### Types for a set of flags are `bitflags`, not enums (C-BITFLAG)

Rust supports `enum` types with explicitly specified discriminants:

```rust
enum Color {
    Red = 0xff0000,
    Green = 0x00ff00,
    Blue = 0x0000ff,
}
```

Custom discriminants are useful when an `enum` type needs to be serialized to an
integer value compatibly with some other system/language. They support
"typesafe" APIs: by taking a `Color`, rather than an integer, a function is
guaranteed to get well-formed inputs, even if it later views those inputs as
integers.

An `enum` allows an API to request exactly one choice from among many. Sometimes
an API's input is instead the presence or absence of a set of flags. In C code,
this is often done by having each flag correspond to a particular bit, allowing
a single integer to represent, say, 32 or 64 flags. Rust's [`bitflags`] crate
provides a typesafe representation of this pattern.

[`bitflags`]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate bitflags;

bitflags! {
    struct Flags: u32 {
        const FLAG_A = 0b00000001,
        const FLAG_B = 0b00000010,
        const FLAG_C = 0b00000100,
    }
}

fn f(settings: Flags) {
    if settings.contains(FLAG_A) {
        println!("doing thing A");
    }
    if settings.contains(FLAG_B) {
        println!("doing thing B");
    }
    if settings.contains(FLAG_C) {
        println!("doing thing C");
    }
}

fn main() {
    f(FLAG_A | FLAG_C);
}
```

[C-BUILDER]: #c-builder
<a id="c-builder"></a>
### Builders enable construction of complex values (C-BUILDER)

Some data structures are complicated to construct, due to their construction
needing:

* a large number of inputs
* compound data (e.g. slices)
* optional configuration data
* choice between several flavors

which can easily lead to a large number of distinct constructors with many
arguments each.

If `T` is such a data structure, consider introducing a `T` _builder_:

1. Introduce a separate data type `TBuilder` for incrementally configuring a `T`
   value. When possible, choose a better name: e.g. [`Command`] is the builder
   for a [child process], [`Url`] can be created from a [`ParseOptions`].
2. The builder constructor should take as parameters only the data _required_ to
   make a `T`.
3. The builder should offer a suite of convenient methods for configuration,
   including setting up compound inputs (like slices) incrementally. These
   methods should return `self` to allow chaining.
4. The builder should provide one or more "_terminal_" methods for actually
   building a `T`.

[`Command`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html
[child process]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Child.html
[`Url`]: https://docs.rs/url/1.4.0/url/struct.Url.html
[`ParseOptions`]: https://docs.rs/url/1.4.0/url/struct.ParseOptions.html

The builder pattern is especially appropriate when building a `T` involves side
effects, such as spawning a task or launching a process.

In Rust, there are two variants of the builder pattern, differing in the
treatment of ownership, as described below.

#### Non-consuming builders (preferred):

In some cases, constructing the final `T` does not require the builder itself to
be consumed. The follow variant on [`std::process::Command`] is one example:

[`std::process::Command`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html

```rust
// NOTE: the actual Command API does not use owned Strings;
// this is a simplified version.

pub struct Command {
    program: String,
    args: Vec<String>,
    cwd: Option<String>,
    // etc
}

impl Command {
    pub fn new(program: String) -> Command {
        Command {
            program: program,
            args: Vec::new(),
            cwd: None,
        }
    }

    /// Add an argument to pass to the program.
    pub fn arg(&mut self, arg: String) -> &mut Command {
        self.args.push(arg);
        self
    }

    /// Add multiple arguments to pass to the program.
    pub fn args(&mut self, args: &[String]) -> &mut Command {
        self.args.extend_from_slice(args);
        self
    }

    /// Set the working directory for the child process.
    pub fn current_dir(&mut self, dir: String) -> &mut Command {
        self.cwd = Some(dir);
        self
    }

    /// Executes the command as a child process, which is returned.
    pub fn spawn(&self) -> io::Result<Child> {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Note that the `spawn` method, which actually uses the builder configuration to
spawn a process, takes the builder by immutable reference. This is possible
because spawning the process does not require ownership of the configuration
data.

Because the terminal `spawn` method only needs a reference, the configuration
methods take and return a mutable borrow of `self`.

##### The benefit

By using borrows throughout, `Command` can be used conveniently for both
one-liner and more complex constructions:

```rust
// One-liners
Command::new("/bin/cat").arg("file.txt").spawn();

// Complex configuration
let mut cmd = Command::new("/bin/ls");
cmd.arg(".");
if size_sorted {
    cmd.arg("-S");
}
cmd.spawn();
```

#### Consuming builders:

Sometimes builders must transfer ownership when constructing the final type `T`,
meaning that the terminal methods must take `self` rather than `&self`.

```rust
impl TaskBuilder {
    /// Name the task-to-be.
    pub fn named(mut self, name: String) -> TaskBuilder {
        self.name = Some(name);
        self
    }

    /// Redirect task-local stdout.
    pub fn stdout(mut self, stdout: Box<io::Write + Send>) -> TaskBuilder {
        self.stdout = Some(stdout);
        self
    }

    /// Creates and executes a new child task.
    pub fn spawn<F>(self, f: F) where F: FnOnce() + Send {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Here, the `stdout` configuration involves passing ownership of an `io::Write`,
which must be transferred to the task upon construction (in `spawn`).

When the terminal methods of the builder require ownership, there is a basic
tradeoff:

* If the other builder methods take/return a mutable borrow, the complex
  configuration case will work well, but one-liner configuration becomes
  impossible.

* If the other builder methods take/return an owned `self`, one-liners continue
  to work well but complex configuration is less convenient.

Under the rubric of making easy things easy and hard things possible, all
builder methods for a consuming builder should take and returned an owned
`self`. Then client code works as follows:

```rust
// One-liners
TaskBuilder::new("my_task").spawn(|| { /* ... */ });

// Complex configuration
let mut task = TaskBuilder::new();
task = task.named("my_task_2"); // must re-assign to retain ownership
if reroute {
    task = task.stdout(mywriter);
}
task.spawn(|| { /* ... */ });
```

One-liners work as before, because ownership is threaded through each of the
builder methods until being consumed by `spawn`. Complex configuration, however,
is more verbose: it requires re-assigning the builder at each step.


<a id="dependability"></a>
## Dependability

[C-VALIDATE]: #c-validate
<a id="c-validate"></a>
### Functions validate their arguments (C-VALIDATE)

Rust APIs do _not_ generally follow the [robustness principle]: "be conservative
in what you send; be liberal in what you accept".

[robustness principle]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle

Instead, Rust code should _enforce_ the validity of input whenever practical.

Enforcement can be achieved through the following mechanisms (listed in order of
preference).

#### Static enforcement:

Choose an argument type that rules out bad inputs.

For example, prefer

```rust
fn foo(a: Ascii) { /* ... */ }
```

over

```rust
fn foo(a: u8) { /* ... */ }
```

where `Ascii` is a _wrapper_ around `u8` that guarantees the highest bit is
zero; see [newtype patterns][C-NEWTYPE] for more details on creating typesafe
wrappers.

Static enforcement usually comes at little run-time cost: it pushes the costs to
the boundaries (e.g. when a `u8` is first converted into an `Ascii`). It also
catches bugs early, during compilation, rather than through run-time failures.

On the other hand, some properties are difficult or impossible to express using
types.

#### Dynamic enforcement:

Validate the input as it is processed (or ahead of time, if necessary). Dynamic
checking is often easier to implement than static checking, but has several
downsides:

1. Runtime overhead (unless checking can be done as part of processing the
   input).
2. Delayed detection of bugs.
3. Introduces failure cases, either via `panic!` or `Result`/`Option` types,
   which must then be dealt with by client code.

#### Dynamic enforcement with `debug_assert!`:

Same as dynamic enforcement, but with the possibility of easily turning off
expensive checks for production builds.

#### Dynamic enforcement with opt-out:

Same as dynamic enforcement, but adds sibling functions that opt out of the
checking.

The convention is to mark these opt-out functions with a suffix like
`_unchecked` or by placing them in a `raw` submodule.

The unchecked functions can be used judiciously in cases where (1) performance
dictates avoiding checks and (2) the client is otherwise confident that the
inputs are valid.

[C-DTOR-FAIL]: #c-dtor-fail
<a id="c-dtor-fail"></a>
### Destructors never fail (C-DTOR-FAIL)

Destructors are executed on task failure, and in that context a failing
destructor causes the program to abort.

Instead of failing in a destructor, provide a separate method for checking for
clean teardown, e.g. a `close` method, that returns a `Result` to signal
problems.

[C-DTOR-BLOCK]: #c-dtor-block
<a id="c-dtor-block"></a>
### Destructors that may block have alternatives (C-DTOR-BLOCK)

Similarly, destructors should not invoke blocking operations, which can make
debugging much more difficult. Again, consider providing a separate method for
preparing for an infallible, nonblocking teardown.


<a id="debuggability"></a>
## Debuggability

[C-DEBUG]: #c-debug
<a id="c-debug"></a>
### All public types implement `Debug` (C-DEBUG)

If there are exceptions, they are rare.

[C-DEBUG-NONEMPTY]: #c-debug-nonempty
<a id="c-debug-nonempty"></a>
### `Debug` representation is never empty (C-DEBUG-NONEMPTY)

Even for conceptually empty values, the `Debug` representation should never be
empty.

```rust
let empty_str = "";
assert_eq!(format!("{:?}", empty_str), "\"\"");

let empty_vec = Vec::<bool>::new();
assert_eq!(format!("{:?}", empty_vec), "[]");
```


<a id="future-proofing"></a>
## Future proofing

[C-STRUCT-PRIVATE]: #c-struct-private
<a id="c-struct-private"></a>
### Structs have private fields (C-STRUCT-PRIVATE)

Making a field public is a strong commitment: it pins down a representation
choice, _and_ prevents the type from providing any validation or maintaining any
invariants on the contents of the field, since clients can mutate it arbitrarily.

Public fields are most appropriate for `struct` types in the C spirit: compound,
passive data structures. Otherwise, consider providing getter/setter methods and
hiding fields instead.

[C-NEWTYPE-HIDE]: #c-newtype-hide
<a id="c-newtype-hide"></a>
### Newtypes encapsulate implementation details (C-NEWTYPE-HIDE)

A newtype can be used to hide representation details while making precise
promises to the client.

For example, consider a function `my_transform` that returns a compound iterator
type.

```rust
use std::iter::{Enumerate, Skip};

pub fn my_transform<I: Iterator>(input: I) -> Enumerate<Skip<I>> {
    input.skip(3).enumerate()
}
```

We wish to hide this type from the client, so that the client's view of the
return type is roughly `Iterator<Item = (usize, T)>`. We can do so using the
newtype pattern:

```rust
use std::iter::{Enumerate, Skip};

pub struct MyTransformResult<I>(Enumerate<Skip<I>>);

impl<I: Iterator> Iterator for MyTransformResult<I> {
    type Item = (usize, I::Item);

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.0.next()
    }
}

pub fn my_transform<I: Iterator>(input: I) -> MyTransformResult<I> {
    MyTransformResult(input.skip(3).enumerate())
}
```

Aside from simplifying the signature, this use of newtypes allows us to promise
less to the client. The client does not know _how_ the result iterator is
constructed or represented, which means the representation can change in the
future without breaking client code.

In the future the same thing can be accomplished more concisely with the [`impl
Trait`] feature but this is currently unstable.

[`impl Trait`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1522-conservative-impl-trait.md

```rust
#![feature(conservative_impl_trait)]

pub fn my_transform<I: Iterator>(input: I) -> impl Iterator<Item = (usize, I::Item)> {
    input.skip(3).enumerate()
}
```


<a id="necessities"></a>
## Necessities

[C-STABLE]: #c-stable
<a id="c-stable"></a>
### Public dependencies of a stable crate are stable (C-STABLE)

A crate cannot be stable (>=1.0.0) without all of its public dependencies being
stable.

Public dependencies are crates from which types are used in the public API of
the current crate.

```rust
pub fn do_my_thing(arg: other_crate::TheirThing) { /* ... */ }
```

A crate containing this function cannot be stable unless `other_crate` is also
stable.

Be careful because public dependencies can sneak in at unexpected places.

```rust
pub struct Error {
    private: ErrorImpl,
}

enum ErrorImpl {
    Io(io::Error),
    // Should be okay even if other_crate isn't
    // stable, because ErrorImpl is private.
    Dep(other_crate::Error),
}

// Oh no! This puts other_crate into the public API
// of the current crate.
impl From<other_crate::Error> for Error {
    fn from(err: other_crate::Error) -> Self {
        Error { private: ErrorImpl::Dep(err) }
    }
}
```

[C-PERMISSIVE]: #c-permissive
<a id="c-permissive"></a>
### Crate and its dependencies have a permissive license (C-PERMISSIVE)

The software produced by the Rust project is dual-licensed, under
either the [MIT] or [Apache 2.0] licenses. Crates that simply need the
maximum compatibility with the Rust ecosystem are recommended to do
the same, in the manner described herein. Other options are described
below.

These API guidelines do not provide a detailed explanation of Rust's
license, but there is a small amount said in the [Rust FAQ]. These
guidelines are concerned with matters of interoperability with Rust,
and are not comprehensive over licensing options.

[MIT]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT
[Apache 2.0]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE
[Rust FAQ]: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#why-a-dual-mit-asl2-license

To apply the Rust license to your project, define the `license` field
in your `Cargo.toml` as:

```toml
[package]
name = "..."
version = "..."
authors = ["..."]
license = "MIT/Apache-2.0"
```

And toward the end of your README.md:

```

at your option.

### Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be
dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.
```

Besides the dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license, another common licensing approach
used by Rust crate authors is to apply a single permissive license such as
MIT or BSD. This license scheme is also entirely compatible with Rust's,
because it imposes the minimal restrictions of Rust's MIT license.

Crates that desire perfect license compatibility with Rust are not
recommended to choose only the Apache license. The Apache license,
though it is a permissive license, imposes restrictions beyond the MIT
and BSD licenses that can discourage or prevent their use in some
scenarios, so Apache-only software cannot be used in some situations
where most of the Rust runtime stack can.

The license of a crate's dependencies can affect the restrictions on
distribution of the crate itself, so a permissively-licensed crate
should generally only depend on permissively-licensed crates.
